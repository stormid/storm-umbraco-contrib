# Storm.Umbraco.Contrib
A collection of useful code snippets (helpers, extensions etc) that can be shared across Umbraco projects. 

## Contribute
Create a pull request with the code that you think should be added. 
Ideally this should be project agnostic and only depend on .Net Framework and Umbraco Core packages in order to stay compatible with as many projects as possible.
